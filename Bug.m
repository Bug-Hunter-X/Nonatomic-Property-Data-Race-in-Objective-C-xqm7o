In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between properties declared with `nonatomic` and concurrent access. If multiple threads modify a `nonatomic` property simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms (like locks or atomic operations), data races can occur, leading to unpredictable and hard-to-debug behavior.  The program might appear to work correctly sometimes but fail intermittently, making it particularly insidious.
